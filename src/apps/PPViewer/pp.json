A perfect location, coupled with the bones of a great home and the scope to extend or renovate. The split-level design is light-filled, courtesy of the expansive windows that are prevalent throughout the abode, which also features a neutral colour scheme and rich polished floorboards. On the entry level you\u2019ll find the privately located master bedroom which has built in robes and a spa ensuite overlooking a garden atrium. A hostess kitchen with an adjoining meals area also shares this level; here sleek granite benchtops adorn profile cabinetry, complemented by glass splashbacks and quality stainless steel appliances. A sunken living\/dining room flows on from here, offering stunning vistas to the home\u2019s outdoor areas which comprises a significant tiered deck for alfresco dining and entertaining. There is also a fully fenced in-ground pool which is the perfect place to keep cool in summer, whilst enjoying magnificent views to the Yarran Dheran Nature Reserve; it\u2019s hard to find a more superb backdrop than this. In a final zone, you\u2019ll find two further robed bedrooms (one is currently being used as a second living area), an updated central bathroom and a laundry space. Gas ducted heating, air-conditioning, a gate to the neighbouring reserve, a storage shed and a double carport all add additional appeal, as does a peaceful location in close proximity to desirable amenities. These include quality schools, local buses. Mitcham or Heatherdale train station, Eastlink and local shopping precincts such as Eastland and the Mitcham shopping strip.

Its integration with the bluestone-paved outdoor area also creates a seamless indoor-outdoor aspect the grand entertainer will love.All four bedrooms (master bedrooms with ensuite and walk-in robe) are carpeted to deliver an extra layer of luxury, and speaking of luxury, there\u2019s plenty of that inside each of the glamorous bathrooms, which enjoy the luxurious touch of 40mm stone benchtops and a frameless shower. And in the case of the main bathroom upstairs, it boasts a gorgeous freestanding soaker bath that helps calm your mind and relax your body.A single garage coupled with an extra car space in the driveway provides plenty of space for off-street parking \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing given the amount of time your car will be parked at home considering city-bound bus services along Doncaster Road, Westfield Shoppingtown, Manningham Library, Doncaster Primary School, Doncaster Secondary College, Schramms Reserve and Ruffey Lake Park are all within walking distance!
